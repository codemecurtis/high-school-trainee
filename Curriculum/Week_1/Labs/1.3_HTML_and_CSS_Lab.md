1.3 HTML and CSS Lab

Make a new folder on your desktop called &quot;MyHTMLSite&quot;. Inside that folder, make a folder called &quot;images&quot;, a folder called &quot;html&quot;, and a folder called &quot;css&quot;.

1. Create two html files in the &quot;html&quot; folder. Name one of them &quot;homepage.html&quot; and the other &quot;subpage.html&quot;.
2. Have a link in &quot;homepage.html&quot; that links to &quot;subpage.html&quot;. Have a link in &quot;subpage.html&quot; that links back to &quot;homepage.html&quot;.
3. Have a link in &quot;homepage.html&quot; that links to a page from the internet.
4. In &quot;homepage.html&quot;, display an image that you saved to your images folder. In &quot;subpage.html&quot;, display an image that you link to from the internet.
5. In &quot;homepage.html&quot;, describe yourself using an unordered list. And in &quot;subpage.html&quot;, describe how you would make your favorite food using an ordered list.
6. Create a separate &quot;style.css&quot; file in the &quot;css&quot; folder. Link to your new stylesheet in the &lt;head&gt; section of your &quot;homepage.html&quot; and &quot;subpage.html&quot;.
7. In your &quot;styles.css&quot; document, define at least one style definition using a class selector and one style definition using an id selector. Make sure you have HTML elements in your home page that use the class and id you defined.
8. Feel free to add other elements to your page to make it your own!
